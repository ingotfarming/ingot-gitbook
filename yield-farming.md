# Yield Farming

Yield Farming is the core of the entire project, through the staking of NFTs or tokens you will increase Ingot tokens .

There are two different pools in Ingot Farming system:

* **Ingot NFT Pool**, here you stake NFTs in charge of Ingot Tokens
* **INGOT/ETH Uniswap LP**, here you stake INGOT/ETH Uniswap LP in charge of Ingot Tokens

 

## Ingot NFT Pool

In this pool, you lock Ingot NFT to farm Ingot Tokens. The higher total energy of your Ingot, the more reward you will receive. Your share in the pool is determined by the power of each Ingot and will be used in combination to the total power of the Pool to determine the amount of percentage of tokens to issue.

Emissions will be deflationary starting at 40 Ingot Tokens per block and halves every 4 weeks until it stabilizes after 24 weeks at 0.625 INGOT per block.

## INGOT/ETH Uniswap LP

**NOTE: This Pool will open after all INGOT NFTs will be sold or burned:  
this is a critical step in order to create a sustainable economy**

In this pool, you stake in INGOT/ETH Uniswap LP token to farm INGOT Tokens. The higher total tokens, the more reward you will receive.

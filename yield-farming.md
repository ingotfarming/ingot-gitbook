# Yield Farming

Yield Farming is the core of the entire project, through the staking of NFTs or tokens you will increase Ingot tokens .

There are two different pools in Ingot Farming system:

* **Ingot NFT Pool**, here you stake NFTs in charge of Ingot Tokens
* **INGOT/BNB Pancake LP**, here you stake INGOT/BNB Pancake LP in charge of Ingot Tokens

 

## Ingot NFT Pool

In this pool, you lock Ingot NFT to farm Ingot Tokens. The higher total Value of your Ingot, the more reward you will receive. Your share in the pool is determined by the Value of each Ingot and will be used in combination to the total Value of the Pool to determine the amount of percentage of tokens to issue.

Emissions will be deflationary starting as defined in Ingot Token section.

## INGOT/BNB Pancake LP

**NOTE: This Pool will be open after all INGOT NFTs will be sold or burned:  
this is a critical step in order to create a sustainable economy**

In this pool, you stake in INGOT/BNB Pancake LP token to farm Ingot Token. The higher total tokens, the more reward you will receive.

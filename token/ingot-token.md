# Ingot Token

## Introduction

Ingot Token is the main fungible token in Ingot Farming ecosystem. It is emitted in a **deflationary** way by the staking of NFTs in Pool Farming.  
Furthermore **to increase deflation,** each time a user buys an Ingot NFT in the store, all tokens spent are immediately burned.

Holders can use the token to buy new NFTs in the store, until reach the mintable limit, voting for governance and trading for other tokens in DeFi system.
